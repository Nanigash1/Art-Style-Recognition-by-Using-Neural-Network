# Recognising-Art-Style-by-Using-Neural-Network
The idea is to use a neural network to analyze artpieces from WikiArts. This could involve tasks such as image classification to identify the artist or art movement associated with a given piece, or object detection to identify specific objects or elements within an image.
There is a code in Ipynb format, and the dataset and model are uploaded to google disk.
